First-AID is a human-in-the-loop (HITL) data collection framework for knowledge-driven generation of synthetic dialogues using LLM prompting. In particular, the framework implements different strategies of data collection that require different user intervention during dialogue generation to reduce post-editing efforts and enhance the quality of generated dialogues.
